        <p>
            Any business's success depends on its employees. Businesses that realize this are concerned about employee output and productivity. Productivity has a compounding effect at the different levels in the workplace, meaning that high productivity at a lower level of organization paves way for higher productivity at the higher levels of the organization. Hence, analysis of performance of employees in any organization is the need of the hour.

            The Employee Performance Prediction system is built with the primary goal of helping organizations gain meaningful insights into their workforce's productivity. 
            Using historical data and key performance indicators, our machine learning model identifies trends and factors that influence an employee's performance over time.
            This enables managers to take proactive measures to foster employee growth, reduce inefficiencies, and promote a supportive work environment.
            The system is designed not just to measure productivity but to support employee development by pointing out potential skill gaps, workload imbalances, or training needs—
            ultimately leading to more informed and empathetic decision-making by management.

                    <h2>How It Perform</h2>
                    <p class="para">Our machine learning model is trained on real-world data including features such as department, team, day, SMV (Standard Minute Value), idle time, number of workers, over time,
                        and other operational metrics. These are the same features that organizations naturally collect during their day-to-day workflow.<br>Based on this input, our system predicts productivity levels using XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression models — comparing their accuracy and selecting the best one.
                        Rather than giving fixed judgments, the tool offers probability-based performance insights to assist in better planning, training, and team management.</p>
